1) A working racktables installation is assumed. No harm can be done since all the operations towards the database are select like.

2) Install the following:
  2.0) sudo apt-get install python 
  2.1) sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
  2.2) sudo apt-get install graphviz
  2.3) sudo apt-get install python-pip
  2.4) sudo pip install graphviz
  
3) Configure the IP/user/pass access data for the MySQL server in the python script:

    db = MySQLdb.connect(host="127.0.0.1", 	# your host, usually localhost
                   	     port=3306,
                         user="user", 			# your username
                         passwd="pass", 	# your password
                         db="racktables") 		# name of the data base

4) Copy files ...

4.1) Copy both the graph.php and draw_topology.py to the /var/www/racktables/plugins directory;
4.2) Copy both logo.png and not.gif to the /var/www/racktables/wwwroot/pix directory;
4.3) Copy gstyle.css to /var/www/racktables/plugins/css directory;

5) Make sure permissions are convenient (in my setup the racktables folder belongs to www-data:www-data).
   This is important because topologies are stored under ./wwwroot/pix/topo folder.

6) In order to build a topology, properly tag all your routers with the same tag. For examples, have a look at:

7) Go to the 'Topology' icon under the main page of Racktables, and invoke the tag used at step 6.

enjoy!
